# Alternative Data Research

Though I'm not sure if what I will be doing here falls under the scope of alternative data, I will be placing projects that I find to be interesting and include working with data regarding the finance sector here. 

Currently, I am working on tracking changes in foot traffic for publicly traded food/restaurant companies across the US throughout Q2. I will use that data and foot traffic data for Q3 to predict earnings reports for those companies. 

Accurate readings starting August 1st.
