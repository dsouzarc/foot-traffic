# Foot Traffic Research

The aim of this project is to predict earning for publicly traded food chains using foot traffic as a proxy metric.

Foot traffic data was collected daily throughout Q3 ad Q4 using the Foursquare API. It will be used with earnings reports to predict the earnings for Q4.

The ten chains are:
- Starbucks
- Costco
- Bojangles
- Dennys
- Panera
- Chipotle
- Wendys
- Flanigans
- Jamba
- Sonic


Analysis:

I missed most of the first month of Q3, so I will start my analysis with July 30th, until September 30th. To better see any trends, for every location I will take a point every week for this period from the raw data.
