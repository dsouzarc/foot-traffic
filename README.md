# Foot Traffic Research

The aim of this project is to predict earning for publicly traded food chains using foot traffic as a proxy metric.

Foot traffic data was collected daily throughout Q3 ad Q4 using the Foursquare API. It will be used with earnings reports to predict the earnings for Q4.

The ten chains are:
- Starbucks
- Costco
- Bojangles
- Dennys
- Panera
- Chipotle
- Wendys
- Flanigans
- Jamba
- Sonic
